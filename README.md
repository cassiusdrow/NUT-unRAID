Network UPS Tools (NUT) for UNRAID
================

The NUT plugin for UNRAID has been developed by various people since 2015.

This fork is my personal interest to modernize and streamline the existing code base and its dependencies.

My vision for this plugin, which basically acts as a frontend to NUT, can be summed up as follows:

* Debloated code with a consistent structure, permissioning and packaging throughout the project.

* Frequent updates of the NUT backend with fresh builds from the official master branch for the lastest changes.

* Frequent updates of the NUT frontend with meaningful changes improving both long term stability and ease of use.
